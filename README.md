# clj-evohome

A Clojure library to query and configure a Honeywell EVO Home system
(aka TCC).

## Usage

Require the library in your source code. The API2 is probably what you
want to use:

```clojure
(require '[clj-evohome.api2 :as eh])
```

First and foremost you need to connect to the cloud

```clojure
(def c (eh/connect "username" "password"))
```

To get information about your account

```clojure
(def acc-info (eh/user-account-info c))
```

List all the installations belonging to a user

```clojure
(def insts (eh/installations-by-user c (:user-id acc-info)))
```

Get the installation at a specific location

```clojure
(def inst1 (installation-by-location c (get-in (first insts) [:location-info :location-id])))
```

Get a system status and change its mode

```clojure
(def system (-> inst1
                :gateways
                first
                :temperature-control-systems
                first))
(get-system-status c (:system-id system))
(set-system-mode c (:system-id system) :dayoff)
```

Get a specific zone's schedule

```clojure
(def zone (first (:zones system)))
(def sched (get-zone-schedule c (:zone-id zone)))
```

Set a zone schedule

```clojure
(set-zone-schedule c (:zone-id zone) sched)
```

Override a zone temperature

```clojure
(set-zone-temperature c (:zone-id zone) 17.5)
```

Cancel a zone override

```clojure
(cancel-zone-override c (:zone-id zone))
```

Get a location status

```clojure
(get-location-status c (get-in inst1 [:location-info :location-id]))
```
