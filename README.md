# clj-evohome

A Clojure library to query and configure Honeywell EVO Home (aka TCC)
installations.

The library interact with the REST API of the cloud service.  Those
servers do the actual talking with your Honeywell devices.  That is,
you need an internet connection.


## Usage

Require the library in your source code

```clojure
(require '[clj-evohome.api :as eh])
```

First you need to authenticate yourself with the server

```clojure
(def c (eh/authenticate-client "username" "password"))
```

Get information about your account

```clojure
(def acc-info (eh/user-account-info c))
```

List all the installations belonging to a user

```clojure
(def insts (eh/installations-by-user c (:user-id acc-info)))
```

Get the installation at a specific location

```clojure
(def inst1 (installation-by-location c (get-in (first insts) [:location-info :location-id])))
```

Get a system status and change its mode

```clojure
(def system (-> inst1
                :gateways
                first
                :temperature-control-systems
                first))
(get-system-status c (:system-id system))
(set-system-mode c (:system-id system) :dayoff)
```

Get a specific zone's schedule

```clojure
(def zone (first (:zones system)))
(def sched (get-zone-schedule c (:zone-id zone)))
```

Set a zone schedule

```clojure
(set-zone-schedule c (:zone-id zone) sched)
```

Override a zone temperature

```clojure
(set-zone-temperature c (:zone-id zone) 17.5)
```

Cancel a zone override

```clojure
(cancel-zone-override c (:zone-id zone))
```

Get a location status

```clojure
(get-location-status c (get-in inst1 [:location-info :location-id]))
```
